DIY UV-C Light cabinet to sterilise used FFR mask
Welcome to the C19UVCSteriliserForFFR Project


Project registered with HelpWithCovid - UV-C Light cabinet to decontaminate used FFR masks

#Objective
The current shortage of filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) might be alleviated if they could be reused by decontaminating them in a simple device - i.e. something a DIY person could build and supply to hospitals, GP surgeries, etc. There is evidence that a UV-C light cabinet might serve this purpose. This project seeks to encourage the production of such cabinets with the following key characteristics:

constructed from a design which has been tested for its effectiveness in decontaminating FFR masks against the SARS-Cov-2 virus as well as for its operator safety. Above all else the cabinet must be safe.
built at home using cheap, readily available components. DIY construction avoids the need for setting-up manufacturing facilities, distribution, etc.
checked for use at each location according to applicable regulations. The use of a DIY appliance at a hospital or GP surgery needs careful consideration, but at a minimum an electrician will need to check the cabinet is constructed according to the design and is safe to use.
used according to Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the design. A key part of the design is the production of clear instructions for the safe use of the cabinet which can be adapted for local requirements.
We envisage that multiple groups will undertake the development of a design and its subsequent testing. This Head Project aims to support such groups by sharing information and providing common standards. To this end we will develop our own design in order to explore the problems others will face. We also aim to act as a central resource for DIY people seeking to select a verified design from which to build their own cabinets.

#Current Status
Initial design for prototype v4.0 completed.
Seeking peer review of design and interest from scientists able to test the prototype for SARS-Cov-2 (virus causing Covid-19), particularly help with determining the exposure times for various types of UV-C bulbs and box sizes (d, angle theta).
Help needed in sourcing components, especially UV-C bulbs.
#Design History
prototype v4.0 - 04-Apr-20: first published prototype - NOT READY FOR USE
